TermSheet Validation using AI
Problem Statement

TermSheet Validation using AI

Challenge:

In the markets post-trade areas, our teams face significant challenges managing the high volume of term sheets each month. The manual validation process is time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive, leading to delays, inaccuracies, and increased risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

The Middle Office handles a high volume of term sheets daily, making it difficult to maintain accuracy and efficiency.
The manual process is prone to human errors, resulting in trade validation inaccuracies.
Significant human resources are required for manual validation, which could be better utilized in strategic tasks.
Technology:

Term sheets can come in various formats, including unstructured formats such as emails, chats, and messages. They can also be in structured formats like Word documents, PDFs, and Excel spreadsheets

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): This technology can be used to extract text from images or scanned documents.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP can be used to understand and process the unstructured text in term sheets.
Machine Learning (ML): ML algorithms can be trained to recognize and validate the data extracted from term sheets.
AI-driven Data Extraction: AI models can be used to extract relevant data from term sheets and validate it against predefined criteria.
Data:

Sample data: Will be provided either Public or masked during the Finale event.
Public Data: Students can use publicly available data to train their models if required.
Design Considerations:

Data Formats and Extraction
Integration with Core Applications
Validation and Automation: Implement AI-driven data extraction and validation to automatically extract relevant data from term sheets and validate it against predefined criteria.
Feedback Mechanism
Security and Compliance
User Experience
Scalability and Flexibility
Other Considerations:

This solution would have an input and output which would further need to be connected to a core application or an appropriate format.
Maintain high-quality data to improve accuracy and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
Regular data cleansing processes should be in place to ensure that the data used for validation is accurate and up-to-date.
Benefits:

Increased Efficiency:
Streamlined processes
Faster validation times
Improved Accuracy:
Reduction in human errors
Higher precision in data handling
Cost Savings:
Lower operational costs
Reduced need for manual intervention
Enhanced Compliance:
Better adherence to regulatory requirements
Minimized risk of non-compliance
